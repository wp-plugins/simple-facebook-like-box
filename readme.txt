A simple widget to add the Facebook Like Box to your Wordpress site. Just activate, fill in one field, and voila! No messy setup, and 100% free!

== Description ==

Simple Facebook Like Box is a very simple, very free alternative to the not-so-simple, not-so-free alternatives out there. It comes in the form of a widget. The only settings are easily found and updated on the widget page itself; no extra menus or options pages! It can be installed and activated in three super-easy steps, as described below.

But there's more! If you're into insights and you have a Facebook app, you can configure the widget to use your App ID. You can also set the background color of the widget and decide whether the widget will show faces, your page's stream, a border, and the "Find us on Facebook" header. You can also set the color scheme (light or dark) and the width of the widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `simple-facebook-likebox.zip` to the Plugins page. For the more manually inclined, place `simple-facebook-likebox.zip` to `/wp-content/plugins/` and unzip.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the widget wherever you want through the 'Appearance -> Widgets' interface.  Make sure to fill out the page identifier!
